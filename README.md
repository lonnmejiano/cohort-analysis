# 📊 Business Analytics Review

## Overview
This project explores customer retention trends over time using **cohort analysis**. By grouping users based on their first purchase month and tracking their behavior in subsequent months, we uncover patterns of churn, engagement, and potential reactivation windows.

This analysis equips stakeholders with actionable insights to enhance retention strategies and reduce customer churn.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Identify customer lifecycle patterns through cohort segmentation
- Measure retention rates over a 4-month period post-acquisition
- Visualize cohort decay and identify strong-performing acquisition months
- Recommend data-backed strategies for improving re-engagement

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized customer transaction data:
- **User ID**
- **First Purchase Date**
- **Subsequent Purchase Dates**
- **Revenue / Sessions per Visit**

Cohorts were created using `first_purchase_month` to define when a customer joined.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Cohort grouping, retention calculations, session-based queries
- **Excel** – Pivot tables, retention matrix, conditional formatting
- **Tableau (optional)** – Cohort decay heatmaps and trend lines

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Month 1 retention averaged **~50%**, with a steep drop by Month 3 to **under 20%**
- Customers from September and October cohorts showed higher lifetime engagement
- Return session rate per cohort dropped ~70% by Month 4, signaling a need for earlier retention tactics

## 💡Strategic Recommendation
- Launch re-engagement campaigns around **30–60 days** post-signup
- Segment users by early activity levels to personalize retention offers
- Incentivize Month 2 purchases to extend the lifecycle
